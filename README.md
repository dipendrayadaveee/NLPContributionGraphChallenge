# NLPContributionGraphChallenge
This repo contains jupyter notebook implementation of `research problem extraction system` on NLPContributionGraph (NCG) challenge dataset ([training dataset](https://github.com/ncg-task/training-data)).
Given below is the evaluation results of the implemented BLSTM model on [test dataset](https://github.com/ncg-task/test-data):
| Metrics (weighted avg) | Precision  | Recall  | F1_score  |
| ------- | --- | --- | --- |
| Score | 0.81 | 0.78 | 0.79 |

For information regarding the implementation, please look into the notebook :).
